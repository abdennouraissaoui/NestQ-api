    <p>
      Prior to October 2010, my parents enjoyed a life close to their family
      members and friends of more than a decade. Both worked hard for their
      career and played a vital role in their community as medical doctors. All
      this has changed after they made a very difficult decision.
      <br /> <br />
      To my parents, immigrating to Canada was like starting life from scratch.
      They had no friends or family nearby. Their medical degrees carried no
      value there – they had no choice but to work odd jobs in order to support
      me and my siblings. I will never forget the memory of the day where we had
      to walk back home with heavy groceries for several kilometers simply
      because we did not have enough for a bus fare.
      <br />
      <br />
      As the eldest child, I deeply felt my parents’ struggles due to the
      sacrifices made for me and my siblings so we could have more
      opportunities. There is nothing that drives me more than my willingness to
      provide my parents with the amazing life they deserve and make them proud
      for their decision to move to Canada.
